The HTML files here are built from markdown files.

To make changes, modify the corresponding Markdown file, then run `make build`. Before that, you'll need to run `make install` to ensure you have the required dependencies. If you'd like to remove the HTML generated by this process, run `make clean`.

If you need to make changes to the template that the markdown files are using, modify `template.sh`, which is a self executing Bash template (reads HTML content from STDIN).

If you run into problems, contact Troy Howard (thoward37@gmail.com).
