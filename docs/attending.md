We have a few opportunities for folks that can't afford the independent tickets, but still want to attend.

### Submit A Talk
As you might expect, our [speakers] do not pay to attend. In fact, we do our best to cover their travel and lodging expenses, and a number of other small perks.

Of course, we can't accept every talk that is proposed, but, if you submit a talk and we don't accept it, you'll still get a discount code to show our appreciation. It's worth the effort to [submit a talk][speakers], and who knows, you might find yourself on stage!

### Volunteering
Becoming a volunteer for .NET Fringe entitles you to a free ticket. We have a ton of stuff to do during the conference, and before. If you'd like to be involved, send us an email to [dotnetfringe@gmail.com], and we'll get you signed up!

### Apply For a Free Ticket
We understand that not everyone can afford a ticket, or is able to volunteer. That's ok! We've got a few tickets set aside for situations like this.

We handle this on a case-by-case basis, so please send us an email to [dotnetfringe@gmail.com] explaining your situation and we'll do our best to help out.
