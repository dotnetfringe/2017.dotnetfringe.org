.NET Fringe is organized by a small team of people based in Portland, Oregon. The team varies each year, but was originally founded by [Troy Howard] and [Adron Hall].

Our organizing team has a variety of responsibilities that all contribute towards delivering an awesome experience for our attendees and speakers. We've formalized those into the following roles:

Additionally, they manage the budget, set ticket pricing, manage the ticketing system, invoice sponsors and make the final decisions about how we spend the money generated from ticket sales and sponsorships. 

They also help the other roles organize their work and fill in wherever needed, from sweeping the floor to updating the website, to ordering stickers.
