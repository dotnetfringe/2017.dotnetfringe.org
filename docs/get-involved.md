The Organizing Team
-------------------

.NET Fringe is organized by a small team of people based in Portland, Oregon. The team varies each year, but was originally founded by [Troy Howard] and [Adron Hall].

Our organizing team has a variety of responsibilities that all contribute towards delivering an awesome experience for our attendees and speakers. We've formalized those into the following roles: 


## SUPER GENIUS OF CONF

The *SUPER GENIUS OF CONF* oversees the direction of the conference, year after year, and ensures that it stays true to its mission, character and overall *vibe*. 

Additionally, they manage the budget, set ticket pricing, manage the ticketing system, invoice sponsors and make the final decisions about how we spend the money generated from ticket sales and sponsorships. 

They also help the other roles organize their work and fill in wherever needed, from sweeping the floor to updating the website, to ordering stickers. 

For 2017, our *SUPER GENIUS OF CONF* is [Troy Howard].


## CFP Czar

The *CFP Czar* is responsible for managing everything related to our speakers. They open and close the Call For Proposals (CFP), manage the talk selection process, do outreach to invite the best speakers we can find, communicate with potential speakers when a talk is accepted or rejected, coordinate speaker travel, organize the talk schedule, and help ensure the speakers are prepared for their talk. 

After the conference, they manage the process of getting videos uploaded to the site.

For 2017, the .NET Fringe *CFP Czar* is [Lena Hall].
