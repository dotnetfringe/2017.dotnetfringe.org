How To Submit A Proposal
========================

Speaker proposals are handled through GitHub pull requests. Follow the instructions below to submit a talk:

* Create a **GitHub account** if you don't have one already.
* **Fork this repository**.
* Review the **[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dotnetfringe/dotnetfringe.github.io/blob/master/docs/code-of-conduct.md)**.
* **Create and commit a .MD file** in this directory named after the talk title and your name. For example, if your talk is called "Intro To aspnet5 and CQRS" and your name is Jane Doe, name the file **intro-to-aspnet5-and-cqrs_jane-doe.md**.
* When you're ready, **submit a pull request**.
* **Wait patiently** and nicely for us to contact you. We will respond to everyone who submits a proposal even if it's just to say "Thanks but no thanks".


What should be in the proposal?
-------------------------------

Every proposal should have, at minimum, the following information: 

* Your Name
* Your Availability (what days/times you are able to do this presentation)
* Presentation Title
* Presentation Description
* Presentation Duration (typically 30 mins, but we're open minded)

To make this easier, I've created a template you can copy and modify. See [proposal-template_jane-doe.md](https://github.com/dotnetfringe/dotnetfringe.github.io/blob/master/proposals/proposal-template_jane-doe.md) in this directory.

### Bio

If you'd like to add in a **personal bio** or other details like links to your **blog**, **open source projects**, **company**, or what have you, that's completely up to you. Whatever floats your boat. Bios are nice!  :)

### Related Artifacts

If you have any other artifacts that relate to your presentation, like slide decks, code samples, videos, etc, make a directory named the same as your presentation.md and put the files in there. For example, if my proposal was saved in **~/proposals/intro-to-aspnet5-and-cqrs_jane-doe.md**, place the example code in **~/proposals/intro-to-aspnet5-and-cqrs_jane-doe/example-code.js** 

### Contact Info

Also, please make sure we have a way to contact you! Many GitHub accounts have an e-mail address on them, but you might not have that set up in your profile. If we accept your talk, we'll need a way to contact you. 

What are we looking for?
------------------------

We're looking for anything related to **Open Source** and **.NET**, not limited to just these things. It can be .NET, .NET Core Open Source, Best Practices, or how to control the world's robots with this simple awesome library! It's all possible, with the core idea of the .NET Open Source Community.

**Beginners and first-time speakers are welcome!** Don't be shy!

We're also open to suggestions for unconference topics & especially **hardware hacking**. This isn't an "experts only" situation. For example, suppose you really want to hack and talk about Arduinos but don't have a presentation, maybe just some questions or experiences to share? We can set aside a 30 minute block of time where we just dedicate a room to that topic. Anyone can show up who wants to discuss the topic. We're flexible!

We're looking forward to hearing about your awesome ideas!


Thanks,

The Fringe Crew
