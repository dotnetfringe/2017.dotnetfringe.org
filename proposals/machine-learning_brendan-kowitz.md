Description
-----------

In most applications, we collect, store and report on data. 
Machine Learning and predictive analytics is that next step in completing the feedback cycle. 
What if we can start making intelligent business and application decisions using the data we already own. 
While you can rough it out and implement some simple algorithms yourself such as Naive Bayes (yes I tried), 
Azure Machine Learning made it surprisingly easy to go from raw data, to trained data model, to a predictive webservice. 
This session will focus on a practical approach in this exciting area to making your applications smarter.
