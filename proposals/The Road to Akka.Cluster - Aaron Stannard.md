Description
-----------

The Akka.NET team recently shipped Akka.Cluster out of beta, and it took two years of hard work across team members working all over the world. Akka.Cluster is the bedrock of distributed systems built using Akka.NET, and it is dependend on by banks, oil & gas, healthcare companies, ecommerce, and scores of other massive businesses. It has to be SOLID.

So in the process of building it we developed one of the most robust, aggressive, and generally insane QA processes in the .NET community in order to validate it. This talk describes how to build automated tests, benchmarks, multi-system tests, model-based tests, and everything else a .NET developer might need to build and test mission-critical / performance-sensitive distributed systems.

NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.
