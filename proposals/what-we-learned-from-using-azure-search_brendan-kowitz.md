Description
-----------

You have a large website. So how do you provide a good user experience in finding content? 
This is the initial question that led us to using Azure Search, however, indexing content 
and basic querying is only the beginning. This session will cover many of the ways 
Azure Search was integrated into azure.microsoft.com from increasing the 
contextual awareness of results to facets and freshness scoring. 
Having content is powerful, how you expose it is even more powerful.
