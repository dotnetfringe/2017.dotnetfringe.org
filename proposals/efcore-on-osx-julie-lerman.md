EFCore on OSX. The Julia Childs/Lerman Recipe
========================

* Speaker   : Julie Lerman
* Available : July 10, 11, 12
* Length    : 45 minutes (can aim for 30 if I must)

Description
-----------
ASPNET Core and EF Core are so cross-platform that not only can you deploy your apps to OSX and Linux (oh, and Windows, too) but you can even build them on any of the platforms.

- Pick a platform. I'll choose OSX because MacBook  
- Grab an x-platform, open source IDE that does C#: I'll take Visual Studio Code, written in Electron, cuz I already use that for Node.  
- Need a data store: Hey, how about PostreSQL, because I never got to use that before.
- Build a Web API that can persist to PostgreSQL. I'll use ASP.NET Core and EF Core because I have a lot of experience in those already.
- Code, debug, git commit. (And show off some of the awesome new features in EF Core)
- Deploy to a Linux server (thank you Docker).
- Invite the world to use your API.
