Description
-----------

"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." Domain modeling is the study of Advanced Naming. When taking on a subject as hard as naming, you want all the best tools at your disposal.

Modern languages like F#, Scala, Swift, and Rust provide an efficient domain modeling tool called Sum Types. Sum Types allow a representation of the domain that is easy to model and fast to change. Several of the patterns can even be applied in C# today!

We will talk about three Sum Type patterns to easily model a sophisticated domain. I will show how Sum Types in F# helped my team model our complex Enterprise banking system concepts, and how you can use them to tame your domain!
