# Ship The Stub

* Speaker   : Tim Rayburn
* Available : July 10-12th
* Length    : 30 min

## Description

Managing open source software development is hard, but can be terribly rewarding.  One thing which many libraries could benefit from though is to make the concept of testing a first class citizen in their software, and to ship a full fledge testing stub as part of the library.  Taken from personal experiences of learning this lesson for the Highway Framework, this session takes you on the journey from denial to acceptance of this critical concept.
