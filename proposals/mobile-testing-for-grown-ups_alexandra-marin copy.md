Description

If you’re anything like me, coming on to a new project is terrifying: unknown domain, indecipherable (yes, I had autocorrect rewrite that word) tests and general panic. And I love unit tests as much as the next face-deep-in-code 24/7 developer, but that’s a limited way of testing your app and we can do better.

So let’s take a swing at turning specifications into concrete, executable and easy-to-repeat behavior. The result is powerful UI acceptance testing by performing common behaviors like pressing buttons, making swipe gestures and entering text. Oh, and did I mention you can automate all this?
