Description
-----------
  Hypermedia and unicorns are so 2011! The next evolution in APIs on the web may well be linked data. With the recent adoption of json-ld by Google, we may finally be seeing the semantic web break into our world, providing the benefits of graphs to extract semantics from your APIs. We will discover, by visiting a magical world, what resources are and how they relate to one another. Don't be afraid, you will discover many mythical creatures, from  resources and tuples to json-ld, hydra, and maybe even a sprinkle of RDF. So come feed the links!
