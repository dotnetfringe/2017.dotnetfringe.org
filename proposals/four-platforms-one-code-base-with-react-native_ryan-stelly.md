Description
-----------

Wasn't it a relief when browsers started to align their feature sets and behavior? We suddenly had more time to spend working out business problems (fun!), rather than differing box model implementations (still fun, but frustratingly not as profitable).

Similarly, with the variety of devices today, it seems downright silly to reinvent our applications time and again for different platforms. Anyone who's gone from building iOS and Android apps in parallel can probably give you an earful. Solutions like Xamarin make great progress towards a common interface, but that's only part of the puzzle, and static languages aren't for everyone.

Enter... React Native. Built on top of the mature ecosystem around React, a popular JavaScript framework, React Native allows for a common interface for developing for a number of platforms. The most popularly supported platforms are iOS and Android, but thanks to the tireless work of contributors in the React Community, I'll show off how you can use a single codebase and library of components to target iOS, Android, the web, and the Windows Universal Platform.

I'll also demonstrate some of the powerful tooling offered by Visual Studio Code and React Native for building, testing, and debugging apps. Have you ever wanted to see a text editor used to debug JavaScript running on an Android phone? Get ready to!
