* Available : Whenever
* Length    : 40-60 minutes

Talk abstract
-----------

Domain specific languages are perfect for describing complex business rules and maintaining complex configuration. Yet not many developers decides to build their own language. Building custom languages using parsers and lexers generators is quite easy. During this presentation I will show you how I've build two languages to support code competition system for JSON based language. After this presentation you should know enough to grab parser generator of your choice and start building your own language.


Motivation and notes
-----------
Talk examples will be in F#.

Motivation here is to encourage developers to create custom languages suited for their unique domain and not get discouraged by vague terminology used by parsers and lexers designers.
