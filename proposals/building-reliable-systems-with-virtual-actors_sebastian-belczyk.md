Building reliable systems with Virtual Actors
========================

* Speaker   : Sebastian Belczyk
* Available : Whenever
* Length    : 40-60 minutes

Talk abstract
-----------

Actor model is a computational model specifically suited for building distributed, high-performance, fault tolerant systems. However, the popular actor model platforms still leave many distributed system problems to the developers.

Virtual Actors is an abstraction over actor model which helps developers deal with reliability and distributed resource management at the same time retaining the best traits of actor model.

Orleans was the first framework which implements runtime for virtual actors. In this talk I'll explain what are virtual actors and show you how to use them to build reliable, distributed applications. I'll also report on production uses and it's performance.

Motivation
-----------
In this talk I want inspire people to explore different models and paradigms in software development. I want to show them that there is something else apart traditional stateless 3-tier architectures build with object oriented paradigm. Especially when scalability, reliability and performance are "must have" requirements.

Virtual actors is an recent addition to actor model proposed by researchers based on their experience in building platforms for distributed systems.

Understanding how actor model and virtual actors work gives you unique insight into building reliable, high-performance distributed systems.
