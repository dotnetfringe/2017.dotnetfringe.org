Metaprogramming in C# 7 with Roslyn
========================

* Speaker   : Amadeusz Wieczorek
* Available : Any time
* Length    : 30 mins

Description
-----------

The open source C# compiler *Roslyn* debuted in 2015, bringing us C# 6 that made the language more expressive. The [C# 7 roadmap](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/2136) shows a similar trend, realized through the **generators feature** and **replace/original keywords**. This presentation will show how these features will help us remove boilerplate code, and how they open the doors for metaprogramming scenarios. 

I will show what does the end result of code generation look like. We will discuss why metaprogramming is important, what we can get out of it, and how you can get involved. We will also see how Generators position themselves in the current landscape of C# metaprogramming projects. 

Code generation comes with its own unique challenges and IDE limitations. We will explore the cause of these challenges and how the architects behind Generators dealt with them.
