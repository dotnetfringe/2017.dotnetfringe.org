Mastering Cassandra on Docker with F#
========================

* Speaker   : Natallia Dzenisenka, Alena Hall
* Available : Apr 17 - 19
* Length    : 30 - 40 minutes

Description
-----------
Data is everywhere. Open source world gives us an opportunity to use advanced technical solutions to handle not uncommon problems of huge amounts of data that require low latency access. Can we use our favorite languages such as functional-first F# or C# for that? The answer is yes! This talk is focused on showing how to create a Cassandra cluster based on Docker, and how to build an application that connects to it and uses it with F# and .NET in a cross platform way! We will demonstrate the power of fringe .NET, showing how easy it is to use fully open source tools such as F# with Project Scaffold in Xamarin Studio on OSX to create a .NET solution that uses advanced open source distributed database Cassandra on Docker.
