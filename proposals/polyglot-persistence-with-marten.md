# Polyglot Persistence with Postgresql and Marten

The Open Source Postgresql database engine might just be the "do anything" tool you need for most any persistence need you have in your system.
Using the OSS [Marten](http://jasperfx.github.io/marten) library, .Net developers can now treat Postgresql like a fully functional document database with all the productivity benefits
that brings, while still having all the grown up DevOps tools that come with an established database platform. In this talk I'll demonstrate how Marten
makes it easy to use high productivity document database techniques. I'll also show the powerful features like batch querying, includes, and compiled
queries you can use to make your application more efficient. For "polyglot" persistence, Marten also includes an event store feature with a powerful
and flexible subsystem for readside projections to make event sourcing an effective technique inside of CQRS based architectures. Lastly, because
sometimes you may still want to use a relational database as just that, I'll show you how you can use Dapper or just straight up database calls within
the same transactional boundaries as the document database or event store features.

I'm available on any day of the conference, and I'd prefer to have 45 minutes, but I could just 
cut out material and make it down to 30.
