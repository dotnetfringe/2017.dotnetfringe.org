Description
-----------

Microsoft Band is one of the most exciting pieces of Microsoft hardware available and rightfully so, given its guided workouts , various sensors, and most importantly, integration with multiple platforms.  In addition to the cross platform capabilities of the Band, the Microsoft acquisition of Xamarin is now official, which allows developers to build native cross-platform mobile applications with C#.  So, what better way to show of Microsoft's initiative for supporting multiple platforms than to build a cross-platform Xamarin application that leverages the Microsoft Band on Android, IOS, and Windows.

In this session, we will start by taking a look at Microsoft's involvement and support of competitive platforms and why it is crucial to our success in our tools and the cloud.  From there, we will walk through an overview of Xamarin, techniques for sharing code, as well as the Xamarin component store, where developers can download components that allow them to integrate with third party services.  We will then install and use the Microsoft Band Component to start tracking data from sensors such as Accelerometer, Heart Rate, Pedometer, etc.
