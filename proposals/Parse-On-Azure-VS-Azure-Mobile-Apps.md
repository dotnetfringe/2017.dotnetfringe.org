Description
-----------

Parse quickly became one of the most talked about platforms for supporting mobile applications in the past couple of years until the announcements of its retirement in January of 2016.  The speed and ease with which developers could power their mobile applications was undeniable, but many developers were left with the dilemma of how to proceed.  Fortunately, Parse provided an open source version of its server and Azure was proactive in providing a managed Parse service.   Additionally, Azure also has a service called Mobile Apps that provides similar functionality.  Come join this session to compare and contrast Parse and Mobile Apps in action.

In this session, we will walk through the creation process of both Parse on Azure and Azure Mobile Apps.  After creating the services, we will leverage the Android SDK for each walking through code samples of inputting and reading data, login functionality, and more.  As we do, we will discuss benefits and gaps of each mobile backend empowering you to have a more educated conversation with developers and customers.
