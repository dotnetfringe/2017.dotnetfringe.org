Speaker Bio

While I love making technology, what gets me out of bed in the morning is helping people accomplish ambitious goals. Whether I'm solving organizational challenges, leading teams, writing code or presenting new concepts, I bring vision, experience, and positive energy. 
A three time CTO, and now consultant and member of the Head of Tech group for ThoughtWorks, I've led several teams to success in large scale projects. While I started my career as a UNIX admin, I'm the author of ServiceStack 4 Cookbook, and a Microsoft MVP.
