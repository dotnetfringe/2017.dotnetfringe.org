Let's talk about microoptimizations
========================

* Speaker   : Andrey Akinshin
* Available : All conference days
* Length    : 40-60 minutes

Description
-----------

This talk is about a wonderful world of microoptimizations and microperformance. We will duscuss different low-level factors which can affect your performance:

* Runtime
  *MS.NET vs Mono vs CoreCLR*
* IL
 *old C# compilers vs Roslyn*
* ASM (inlining, bound check elimination, loop unrolling, SIMD, and so on)
  *LegacyJIT-x86 vs LegacyJIT-x64 vs RyuJIT-x64*
* CPU (CPU cache, branch prediction, instruction-level parallelism, and so on)
  *different processors vs each other*
