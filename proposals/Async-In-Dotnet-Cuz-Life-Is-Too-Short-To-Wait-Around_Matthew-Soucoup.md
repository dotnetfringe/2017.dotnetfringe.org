Description
-----------

Have you ever tried to do more than one thing at once? Like build a campfire and go swimming at the same time? Probably didn’t go too well … the same thing can happen when your application needs to do more than one thing at a time as well. User interfaces lock up … servers reject requests … but add a little asynchronous programming into the mix and things can go smoothly.

In this session we’ll talk about asynchronous programming with .NET. First we will explore the Task class in .NET and the ability it provides code to run asynchronously. We’ll quickly move beyond async/await and cover some more advanced topics such as cancellation and processing results from multiple tasks. We’ll also cover some asynchronous alternatives to Task, such as Reactive Extensions that may be a better fit for your asynchronous needs. Finally – we’ll formulate some design guidelines for converting existing synchronous code into async. When you leave this session, you’ll have the knowledge to keep your apps responsive and scalable no matter how many things get thrown at them.
