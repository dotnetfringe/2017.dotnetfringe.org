EFCore on OSX. The Julia Childs/Lerman Recipe

ASPNET Core and EF Core are so cross-platform that not only can you deploy your apps to OSX and Linux (oh, and Windows, too) but you can even build them on any of the platforms.

Pick a platform. I'll choose OSX because MacBook
Grab an x-platform, open source IDE that does C#: I'll take Visual Studio Code, written in Electron, cuz I already use that for Node.
Need a data store: Hey, how about PostreSQL, because I never got to use that before.
Build a Web API that can persist to PostgreSQL. I'll use ASP.NET Core and EF Core. I can leverage my experience and benefit from loads of great features.
Code, debug, git commit. Rinse & repeat.
Deploy to a Linux server (thank you Docker).
Invite the world to use your API.

Duration: I managed to get this down to 50 minutes once. I can aim for 30 if I must. Just can't show off as many new EF features.
