## Executable Specifications with Storyteller 3

[Storyteller 3](http://storyteller.github.io) is a new tool for creating executable specifications for .NET development projects. 
In a perfect world, you would love to have a good, reliable suite of automated regression tests in your software project. 
However, automating integration tests for complex software systems can be very difficult. In this talk I will show how Storyteller has been built and used to alleviate the typical problems you may have suffered in past attempts at large scale automated testing. 
I'll discuss how we integrated system bootstrapping and teardown, declarative mechanisms for system state setup, and application diagnostics for visibility into system performance â€“ all from within a single testing tool.

The talk would take about 45 minutes, and I'm available on any day of the conference.
