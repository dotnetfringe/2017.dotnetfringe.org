If you want to write .NET code today easiest way to get started is to depend on Microsoft tools, frameworks.  With the new push to make .NET cross platform, things are changing.  Writing C# on a Mac or Linux is no longer a niche, it is becoming a true reality.  Microsoft has even jumped in on the game with Visual Studio Code!

Still for .NET the editor of choice is Visual Studio.  OmniSharp is changing that.  OmniSharp is a family of Open Source projects, each with one goal, to enable a great .NET experience in YOUR editor of choice.  You can take for your favorite text editor and turn it into a full featured IDE.  In this talk I’m going to show you some of these editors and technology behind them.  Come learn about OmniSharp, the cross-platform “IDE in a box”.
