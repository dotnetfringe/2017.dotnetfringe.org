Description
-----------

With Microsoft's focus on supporting competitive mobile platforms through cloud and tooling, it is becoming more important than ever that we have working understanding and knowledge of other platforms.  We are no longer in an era where we are solely pushing developers to create Windows applications but an era in which we help developers with what they are already building while leveraging our technologies.  That said, we acknowledge the appeal and success of the IOS platform and actively support it in various ways.  It is imperative that we be able to talk to developers on their platforms, tools, etc.  Because of this, many of us are either in the process or have been thinking about branching out to learn more about other platforms.

In this session, I will walk through my experience and learnings from diving in to the IOS platform from the perspective of a Windows developer.  You will learn about the resources and tools that I used along the way including tons of free and/or cheap online videos, tutorials, and classes.  You will also be presented with direct comparisons of IDE's, emulators, Visual Designers, languages, and more.  Join this session and walk away with a more thorough understanding of the IOS platform, a knowledge base that will help you when you have conversations with developers and customers.
