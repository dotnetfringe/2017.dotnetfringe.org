Description

You and I both know that .NET is cool … overall arguably the best, most productive development framework out there. But as .NET developers there has not traditionally been a mobile platform to natively develop for, which means an entire skillset mobile developers cultivate has eluded the .NET dev. With Microsoft buying Xamarin, now is the perfect time for .NET developers to expand their abilities and learn mobile development.

In this session we’ll cover several key concepts of mobile development focusing on both why the concept is important and best practices to incorporate it. We’ll also see where to apply that idea outside of the mobile development world. Some of the things we’ll talk about are the significance of asynchronous (or “Don’t Block The UI”), surprising areas when functional programming comes into play, and techniques to create a robust, fast app on an underpowered and only sometimes internet connected device. When you leave this session, you’ll have an understanding of the techniques that mobile developers use in apps and how to apply them elsewhere.
