Description
-----------

Routing for web applications is an area where many libraries tend to give up on static typing, or provide a limited set of features compared to dynamic languages. Why does this gap exist? Can it be closed in F# via a type provider?

In this talk, Isak Sky will show how this problem can be solved. We'll see why developing a truly generic solution turned out not to be possible with a traditional F# type provider, but was possible using by using type providers in a way that was not originally intended. In the end, we'll get a simple library that can work with just about anything, such as Suave, raw Owin, etc, and even serve in roles not normally thought of as routing.
