Description
-----------

Over the past few years, the question of whether to strong name libraries in .NET has at times lead to
[massive comment threads](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/issues/405), strong opinions, and lots
of confusion all around.  Is there ever a legitimate reason to use strong naming?

In this presentation, we'll look at the pain strong naming has caused, the reasons people might want to
use strong names, and the possible workarounds if you need a strong named version of a library that isn't
strong named.  I'll show my [Strong Namer](https://github.com/dsplaisted/strongnamer) project and how it
mostly solves the issue.

Since joining Microsoft in 2008, I've worked on the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), Portable Class Libraries, and the .NET Framework.
Recently I helped [port MSBuild to .NET Core](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/02/23/porting-msbuild-to-net-core/).
I love .NET and Open Source, and have created a couple of OSS projects including [PCL Storage](https://github.com/dsplaisted/pclstorage).
