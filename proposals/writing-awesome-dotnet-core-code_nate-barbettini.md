Speaker Bio

I'm the .NET Developer Evangelist at Stormpath in San Francisco, which means I'm "the dot net guy" in an office full of Java and Node engineers. :smile:

Prior to Stormpath, I was a full-stack developer working in C# and Angular, and ran a video production company producing short films and music videos. On the weekend you'll find me contributing to a number of open-source projects, editing short films, and training for a marathon.
