Description
-----------

Oftentimes during development, we encounter situations when the built-in controls do not provide all of the functionality required by the application. In .NET applications, creating custom controls and adding properties is straightforward. So how is it handled when developing a Xamarin.Android app? In this session, we will cover how to extend the built-in views to provide the additional functionality needed by your app. We will also discuss how you can add custom attributes within your view and assign values to those attributes within the view's XML markup..
