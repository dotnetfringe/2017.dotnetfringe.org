Writing Testable Visual Studio Code Extensions
==============================================

* Speaker   : *Chris Stead*
* Available : *July 10-12* 
* Length    : *~30 minutes*

Description
-----------

We will walk through creating a simple Visual Studio Code extension and integrating testing throughout the entire
process. We will take a look at using Golden Master tests to guarantee all changes to non-executable files are not only checked at
git commit time but also at test time.  We will also use the factory pattern and the Mockery library to break dependency on the 
vscode module so integration points are testable.
